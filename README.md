----------------------------ABOUT ME ----------------------------

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Rayan, but you can call me Rustico. I'm 16 years old and I'm from Brazil, specifically Rio de Janeiro.

ðŸŽ® Since I was young, I've had a passion for technology and games. I spend most of my time immersed in programming and game development projects on the computer. Additionally, I've recently been exploring the fascinating world of robotics, finding new ways to apply my knowledge.

ðŸš€ Although I'm at the beginning of my journey in technology, I'm determined to participate in notable projects and initiatives. I've found inspiration in various influences along the way, which have encouraged me to pursue this journey with determination and passion.

ðŸ’¡ My ultimate goal is to become a renowned developer in the technology industry, exploring areas such as programming, game development, and robotics. I believe that with time, dedication, and patience, we can achieve any goal we set our minds to.

âœ¨ I'm always open to new experiences and challenges, ready to embrace each opportunity with determination and enthusiasm. Let's make it happen!
